# Adaptive-Disaster-Response-Network
The Adaptive Disaster Response Network (ADRN) is a high-performance, command-line simulation that models the communication resilience of a city's critical infrastructure during and after a natural disaster.  The core function is to dynamically maintain connectivity and calculate optimal, low-latency communication paths when network components fail.
